# 📚 Script & Slideshow Generator

A powerful, user-friendly AI tool that automatically generates educational **scripts** and corresponding **PowerPoint presentations** based on your input. Built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive interface, and powered by open-source large language models like **LLaMA 3.2**, this project is perfect for educators, students, and content creators.

---

## 🔧 Features

- 🎯 **Topic-Based Script Generation**: Generate educational scripts based on topic, tone, and target audience.
- 🤖 **Powered by Local LLaMA 3.2**: Efficient and private inference using `Ollama` and `transformers`.
- 🧠 **Intelligent Slide Structuring**: Automatically splits the script into slide-sized chunks with title and content.
- 📊 **PowerPoint Export**: Export slides as `.pptx` and optionally as `.pdf`.
- 🛠 **Interactive UI**: Built with **Streamlit**, requiring no coding knowledge to use.
- 📝 **Editable Presentations**: Users can modify the content before exporting.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) to run LLaMA 3.2 locally
- PowerPoint (optional, for viewing `.pptx` files)

### 📦 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aryan6336/IITISoC-25-AIML-7-Script-Slideshow-Generator.git
cd IITISoC-25-AIML-7-Script-Slideshow-Generator
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
uvicorn streamlit run app/ui.py
```

### Application Workflow:

1. **Input & Generation**
   - User enters the topic, audience, and tone.
   - Click “Generate Script” to invoke the LLaMA model via Ollama.

2. **Script Output**
   - After processing, the script appears in editable format.
   - Users can preview or edit the content.

3. **Slide Creation**
   - On clicking “Create Slides”, the script is automatically structured into slides (title + content).
   - Template-specific layout logic is applied.

4. **Export Options**
   - Users can choose to download the presentation as a `.pptx` or `.pdf`.

5. **Live Editing**
   - Each slide's content can be manually edited before exporting.
